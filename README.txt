This project tells the story about my high school, where there is a dean of student who always takes students' phone when they are seen using it. 
This project is made using Processing, for Honors Data Structure. The idea is to make "the dean", we will call him Mr.Ware (get it? aware, beware?)
But essentially what we want him to do, is to save his time, locating the nearest phone and come to take it. This project aims to teach us 
about class in comuter science and how to efficiently use class to create objects of the same characteristics.
